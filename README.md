Running the Dev. Servers
========================
Cake tasks wrap up some helpful dev. server commands:

    cake dev:hello            # Run "Hello World #1" development server
    cake dev:hello2           # Run "Hello World #2" development server
    cake dev:chat             # Run chat development server
